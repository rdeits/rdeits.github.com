Recently, I've done a bunch of work to clean up the cryptic crossword clue solver which I first described in [an earlier post](/2013/02/11/a-cryptic-crossword-clue-solver). I have simplified the code layout and added more flexibility to the solver's interface, so it should be easier to experiment and play around with. What follows are a few examples of what the new solver can do. You can also view these examples as [a rendered IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rdeits/cryptics/blob/master/cryptic_demo.ipynb) on nbviewer.org.
