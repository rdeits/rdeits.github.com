My name is Robin Deits. I'm a graduate student at MIT working on a PhD in the Robot Locomotion group, at least until the position of starship chief engineer opens up. 

I'm a physicist/ programmer/ photographer/ pianist/ engineer. 
Here's my [CV](/assets/Robin_Deits_CV.pdf). You can contact me at mail at robindeits.com.

## This Site
This website was created using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) and is hosted as a [github:pages](http://pages.github.com/) site. It's a super cool way to create a blog without all the overhead of something like Wordpress. This site was built using the instructions at [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html)
