My name is Robin Deits. I'm a graduate student at MIT working on a PhD in the Robot Locomotion group, at least until the position of starship chief engineer opens up. 

I'm a physicist/ programmer/ photographer/ pianist/ engineer. 
Here's my [CV](/assets/Robin_Deits_CV.pdf). You can contact me at mail at robindeits.com.
