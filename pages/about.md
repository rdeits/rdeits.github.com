## This Site
This website was created using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) and is hosted as a [github:pages](http://pages.github.com/) site. It's a super cool way to create a blog without all the overhead of something like Wordpress. This site was built using the instructions at [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html)
